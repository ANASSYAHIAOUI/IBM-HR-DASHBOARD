# IBM-HR-DASHBOARD






📊 Enthusiastic about data and passionate about HR analytics, I recently completed an exciting project using Power BI to craft the IBM HR Dashboard.

🔍 In this endeavor, I extracted crucial workforce insights, providing a comprehensive view of our organization. I identified and showcased key trends, including employee headcount, gender distribution, educational levels, departments, education fields, employee roles, as well as age distribution correlated with satisfaction levels.

💡 This dynamic data visualization empowered our HR team to make informed decisions, uncover improvement opportunities, and optimize our workforce.

🌟 I'm proud to have contributed to enhancing our understanding of workforce dynamics and promoting more strategic HR management.

If you'd like to learn more about this project or discuss my data analysis skills, I'd be delighted to connect.
